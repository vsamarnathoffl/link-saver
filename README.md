# Link Saver with Auto-Summary (Next.js - AI Powered App)

## Project Overview

This project is a simple and responsive **AI-powered Bookmark Manager** web app that allows users to save links and generate automatic summaries using the **Jina AI Summarization API**.

It features a minimalist design, local storage for saved bookmarks, and static login credentials for access. This is a take-home technical assignment for a Software Developer Internship at **OMVAD**.

> **Note:** This is a frontend-only app with no backend authentication or persistent database. All data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
